# RecRoomAPI-Fetcher
A small program I used to fetch the data from the game Rec Room's API to collect data on UGC content.

The code containted in this project is by no means my best work, and if someone gives me a reason to I'll refine it, but right now it can fetch the entirety of Rec Room's player generated rooms in less than 12 hours. This may seem slow, but it is forced into being this slow because of the quantity of API calls it makes for the ~1.8 million rooms. The script also formats the data collected into a CSV file, and attatched are a few ways to trim down the file for quality purposes. 

If you have any questions regarding Rec Room's API or the project, leave an issue on this repo (I'm new to github, don't shoot me if that's not proper ettiquete) or on Discord at @flipflopnoob
